## P1: Circles matrix:
A matrix that contains a circle in each cell. Background color, circle position (x, y), circle size and color change based on mouse position.
 
## P2: Circles matrix v2:
Assign color to rows based on the results of the module operator. Also circles radius increase and decrease mapping mouse position on the X axis from 0 to 3.1416 and then applying the sin function times some value, so the max radius in reached when mouse position is half the width of the interface.
